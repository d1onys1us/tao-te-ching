# README

This is trying to present the Tao Te Ching in a way more readable to me, especially on mobile. This is for personal use only, not meant for any distribution. I did not write this translation at all it's just so I can read it more easily on my own.

## Python scripts

Some python scripts in here from chatGPT to try to get a nice json to work with.

- This uses a virtualenv: `python3 -m venv venv`.
- Init it with fish with `source venv/bin/activate.fish`.
- After that install what you need: `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`.
- Use `python script.py` to regenerate the `taoteching.json`.

## Astro frontend

Astro project at `./tao-front`, to render the json into a page.
